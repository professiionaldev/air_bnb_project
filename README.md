Problem Statement:

The Airbnb dataset presents a multitude of business challenges. These encompass optimizing pricing, forecasting demand, enhancing customer experiences, detecting fraudulent activity, expanding into new markets, retaining hosts, managing inventory, analyzing the competitive landscape, upholding data security and privacy, and prioritizing sustainability. Addressing these challenges through data-driven insights is paramount to strengthening Airbnb's operational efficiency, boosting revenue, and ensuring a superior experience for both hosts and guests.

Business Objective:

The overarching business objective of this Airbnb booking data analysis is to optimize operations, elevate customer experiences, guarantee regulatory compliance, prevent fraud, expand into new markets, and advocate for sustainability - all guided by data-driven insights.

General Guidelines:

Well-structured, formatted, and well-commented code is essential.
Exception handling, production-grade code, and deployment-ready code are highly encouraged.
Deployment-ready code is defined as a complete Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that executes flawlessly without encountering errors.
Clear and concise comments are required for every logical step within the code.
You are free to incorporate as many informative charts as you see fit. However, ensure you address the following questions for each chart:
Rationale behind selecting the specific chart.
Key takeaways gleaned from the chart.
Potential positive or negative business impacts arising from these insights. Justify your reasoning.
A minimum of 20 meaningful and insightful charts should be generated.
Getting Started:

1. Know Your Data

1.1 Import Libraries:

The following libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis:

Python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from numpy import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
Use code with caution.

1.2 Dataset Loading:

Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
Load the CSV file using pandas.
1.3 Dataset First View:

Utilize the head() method to preview the initial rows of the dataset.
1.4 Dataset Rows & Columns Count:

Ascertain the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the dataset using the shape attribute.
1.5 Dataset Information:

Employ the info() method to obtain a concise overview of the data, including data types and missing values.
1.6 Duplicate Values:

Determine the number of duplicate records present in the dataset.
1.7 Missing Values/Null Values:

Identify the count of missing values per column using .isnull().sum().
Optionally, visualize missing value patterns with a heatmap using seaborn.
2. Understanding Your Variables:

2.1 Dataset Columns:

Obtain a list of column names using .columns.
2.2 Dataset Description:

Generate summary statistics for all columns using .describe(include='all').
2.3 Variables Description:

Provide a brief description of each variable, explaining its significance in the context of Airbnb data.

2.4 Check Unique Values for Each Variable:

Investigate the number of unique values within each variable using .nunique().
3. Data Wrangling

3.1 Data Wrangling Code:

Implement code to clean, transform, and prepare your data for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, identifying outliers, and feature engineering if necessary.
3.2 What Did You Do? What Insights Did You Find?

Explain the data wrangling techniques you employed (handling missing values, data cleaning, data transformation, data filtering, and handling categorical variables).
Discuss the insights you discovered during this process, such as:
Room Type: Identifying the most prevalent room type (entire home, private room, shared room) to understand host preferences.
